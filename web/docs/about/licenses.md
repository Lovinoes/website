# Licenses

Calagopus is open source, and most repositories are licensed under the **MIT
License**. The copyright holder varies between repositories (`Calagopus`,
`Calagopus, 0x7d8`, and in one case an outside contributor), and a handful of
repositories are not MIT at all. The tables below are authoritative; when in
doubt, read the `LICENSE` file in the repository itself.

## Repositories

### Core components

### Deployment recipes

| Repository | License | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`calagopus/nix`](https://github.com/calagopus/nix) | MIT | Nix flake for the Panel and Wings. Copyright is held by an outside contributor, not Calagopus. |
| [`calagopus/unraid`](https://github.com/calagopus/unraid) | MIT | Unraid templates and Community Applications profile. |
| [`calagopus/tipi-appstore`](https://github.com/calagopus/tipi-appstore) | WTFPL | Runtipi app store entries. |

### Container images

These repositories contain only packaging - a `Dockerfile` and a build workflow.
The license shown covers that packaging; the software inside the published
images remains under its own upstream license.

| Repository | License | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`calagopus/valkey`](https://github.com/calagopus/valkey) | BSD-3-Clause | Multi-arch image for Valkey. |
| [`calagopus/kopia`](https://github.com/calagopus/kopia) | Apache-2.0 | Multi-arch image for Kopia. |
| [`calagopus/pgautoupgrade`](https://github.com/calagopus/pgautoupgrade) | MIT | Multi-arch image for pgautoupgrade. Downstream of the official Postgres image, so copyright remains with the Docker PostgreSQL Authors. |

## Bundled and vendored components

Some repositories vendor or wrap third-party code whose license differs from the
project's MIT license. These need to be called out for anyone redistributing
Calagopus commercially.

| Component | Location | License | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `unrar-rs` (wrapper) | `wings/unrar-rs` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | The Rust wrapper is permissive. |
| UnRAR C library | `wings/unrar-rs/unrar_sys/vendor/unrar` | **UnRAR license** | Non-free and restrictive. See below. |

The UnRAR dependency is unconditional, so every Wings binary contains it. Its
license permits using the source to *unpack* RAR archives, but explicitly
forbids using it to build a RAR-compatible archiver, and requires the license
text to travel with any redistribution. Read
[`vendor/unrar/license.txt`](https://github.com/calagopus/wings/blob/main/unrar-rs/unrar_sys/vendor/unrar/license.txt)
before shipping Wings as part of a commercial product.

Wings also contains a `pbs-client` crate used for
[Proxmox Backup Server backups](../wings/advanced/backup-configurations.md). It
is a first-party implementation of the PBS wire protocol - no Proxmox source is
vendored - and is covered by the Wings MIT license, not by Proxmox's AGPL.

## Full dependency licenses

The complete transitive dependency license list for the Panel, Wings and the
DB Agent is available from their SBOMs. See
[Software Bill of Materials](./architecture.md#software-bill-of-materials-sbom)
for what an SBOM is and why we publish them.
