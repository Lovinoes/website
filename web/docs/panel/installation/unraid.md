# Unraid Panel Installation

::: warning Unraid 7.3 or later
This guide targets **Unraid 7.3+** and assumes the **Community Applications** plugin is installed (it ships on almost every Unraid install and provides the **Apps** tab).
:::

Calagopus ships an Unraid Community Applications template for the **All-in-One (AIO)** image, bundling the Panel and Wings in a single container. Unlike the [Docker AIO compose stack](./docker.md), the Unraid template does not include PostgreSQL or Valkey, you install those separately from the **Apps** tab onto the same Docker network as the panel.

::: info Running game servers on a NAS
Wings will run fine in this setup, but game servers are CPU- and RAM-intensive workloads that compete with Unraid's array and other containers. This is well-suited for homelab use. For production hosting, consider running Wings on a dedicated machine connected to a standalone Panel instead.
:::

## 1. Create the Docker network

The panel, database, and cache containers all need to share a dedicated network named `calagopus`. Create it from the Unraid terminal:

```bash
docker network create calagopus
```

## 2. Install PostgreSQL and Valkey from the Apps tab

The AIO template expects a PostgreSQL and a Valkey container reachable on the `calagopus` network. Search the **Apps** tab for a PostgreSQL 18 template and a Valkey template, several community-maintained options exist for each, and install both:

- **Container name**: `calagopus-db` for Postgres, `calagopus-cache` for Valkey.
- **Network Type**: set to the custom `calagopus` network on both.
- Postgres environment variables: `POSTGRES_USER=panel`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=panel`, `POSTGRES_DB=panel`.
- Data path: point the PostgreSQL container's persistent volume somewhere under `/mnt/user/appdata/`, e.g. `/mnt/user/appdata/calagopus/postgres`.

::: info Different container names
The panel template's default `DATABASE_URL` (`postgresql://panel:panel@calagopus-db/panel`) and `REDIS_URL` (`redis://calagopus-cache`) reference these container names directly. Keeping them as shown means you don't need to edit those fields in step 4. If you'd rather use different names, users, or a password, that's fine, just carry the changes into the corresponding fields in step 4.
:::

## 3. Create the Wings configuration file

The panel template mounts a Wings config file into the container. If the file does not already exist on the host, Docker creates it as a **directory** instead, which breaks the container, so create it first:

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/user/appdata/calagopus
touch /mnt/user/appdata/calagopus/wings-config.yml
```

You can leave the file empty, the container populates it on first startup.

## 4. Install the template

Back in the **Apps** tab, search for **Calagopus**, and click the template that matches your needs:

| Template | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| **calagopus-aio** | Standard install, Panel + Wings, no extensions |
| **calagopus-heavy-aio** | You plan to install [extensions](../extensions/index.md), includes the build tooling needed to compile them |

On the configuration page:

- **Network Type**: set to the custom `calagopus` network.
- **Encryption Key**, required. Generate a random value from the terminal:

  ```bash
  openssl rand -hex 32
  ```

- **Database URL** / **Redis URL**, default to `postgresql://panel:panel@calagopus-db/panel` and `redis://calagopus-cache`. Only change these if you used different container names in step 2.
- **WebUI Port** / **SFTP Port**, default to `8000` and `2022`. Change these if they conflict with other containers on your Unraid host.

::: info Advanced path mappings
The advanced path mappings (Docker socket, Wings config/data/log/tmp directories, and on the heavy template, the extension build directories) default to subfolders under `/mnt/user/appdata/calagopus/`, leave them unless you have a specific reason to relocate them. If applicable, don't forget to move the wings configuration from step 3. Mounting files outside of the designated mount points may cause files to disappear after a reboot. Use with care.
:::

Click **Apply**. Unraid pulls the image and starts the container.

## 5. Access the Panel

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://unraid-ip:8000
```

You will see the OOBE (Out Of Box Experience) setup screen where you create your first admin account and complete initial configuration.

## Updating

Unraid flags an update icon on the container in the **Docker** tab when a new image is available. Click it and choose **Apply Update**, Unraid pulls the new image and restarts the container; your data volumes are preserved.
